# InviteU

InviteU is a project that aims to create a social network based on events.

## Motivation

A type of social network that is not widespread on the internet today, are social networks that aim to promote the encounter between people. That was where the idea for InviteU came from, a social network that aims to expand the branch of events on the internet.
This social network aims to promote, disseminate and evaluate from giant and already known events, such as Rock in Rio, to family events and with little coverage of people, such as family parties or religious services.
